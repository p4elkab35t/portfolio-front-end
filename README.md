## Introduction 
This simple portfolio app created (is being atm) with two purposes:
1. To create personal website
2. To learn new technologies (currently tailwind, svelte+kit, typescript) to extend my skill range

## Learning log
### May, 15th 2024

Today May, 15th 2024, I learned how to:
- In Svelte: 
  - Store simple values in a browser, using local storage in order to create a persistent darkmode switcher
  - Create custom store with toggle and autoupdate localstorage variable 
  - Create and insert components into a global layout ``` +layout.svelte ``` page file
  - Set darkmode theme using ```dark``` class.
  - Send simple props to ```Nav.svelte``` file
  - Connect tailwind css to svelte project
  - Switch menu variable without store
  - Use loops to create navigation tabs
- In tailwind (most interesting ones):
  - how to use gradient
  - how to use after pseudoclass
  - how to create responsive navigation bar (+mobile menu)
  - how to create fancy switch
  - how to controll hidden elements
  - how to apply gradient to text using ```bg-clip``` class

Using that skills today I've made this navigation bar (*pic. #1*) for portfolio and theme switcher (currenly no theme settings, will be updated)
